<h1><mark><u>What is F1?</u></mark></h1>
<h3> - As the highest class of international racing for single-seater formula racing cars, Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport and the world’s most prestigious motor racing competition. There really is nothing like it. It’s a team sport (it needs to be to change all 4 tyres on a car in under 2 seconds!), but the drivers are more like fighter pilots than sportspeople. Battling extreme g-forces, making daring decisions in the blink of an eye – and at 370km/h. To be the best, F1 drivers push themselves – and their incredibly innovative machines – to the very limit.</h3>
<h3> - A total of 20 drivers and 10 teams makes up the current Formula 1 grid, with each squad fielding two cars.</h3>
<h3>- Why is it called Formula 1 or F1? First up, the ‘Formula’ is a set of rules – covering car design, engine size, component usage and much, much more – that all competitors must abide by. Secondly, the ‘1’ simply denotes that it is the premier formula.
</h3>

<hr>

<h1>F1 HISTORY</h1>
<h3>- Formula 1 was formed as a world championship competition back in 1950, with the first-ever race held at the Silverstone Circuit – a former Royal Air Force station – in the United Kingdom on May 13 of that year.

    Six more events were staged in a season which saw Alfa Romeo driver Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina become the sport’s first world champion – edging out team mates Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli.
    
    While motorsport had been taking place since the late-1800s, with Grand Prix events growing in popularity across the following decades, 1950 marked the start of the official F1 championship that remains to this day.</h3>
    <hr>

    <h1>HOW DOES A F1 CAR WORK?</h1>
    <h3> - Thousands of parts are involved in creating some of the fastest and most advanced racing cars on the planet – spanning detailed bodywork, suspension elements, turbo-hybrid power units, eight-speed paddle shift gearboxes, 18-inch tyres and much, much more. <br><br>

        When the engine powers it forward, an F1 car essentially acts as an aeroplane flipped upside down, with front and rear wings – and everything in between – pushing the car down onto the track and giving it incredible levels of grip through corners. <br><br>
        
        
        That said, F1’s current technical regulations are based around a ‘ground effect’ aerodynamic concept, with several carefully designed tunnels underneath the car’s floor sucking the car to the track surface to generate even more downforce. <br><br>
        
        This, combined with simpler bodywork than previous years, means less ‘dirty air’ – or disrupted airflow – is created and allows cars to follow each other more closely, opening up additional overtaking opportunities and adding to the on-track spectacle. <br><br> </h3>
        <hr>

        <h1>WHERE DOES F1 RACE?</h1>
        <h3>
            A total of 24 races in 21 countries across five continents are included on the Formula 1 calendar. Classic tracks such as Silverstone, Spa-Francorchamps and Suzuka, combined with more recent additions including Las Vegas, Miami and Saudi Arabia give an exciting and varied selection of circuits that offers plenty to look forward to. <br><br>
            
            Monaco, Monza, Silverstone and Spa are circuits that still feature on the F1 calendar from the very first season in 1950, although plenty of safety-based changes and track layout modifications have been made since then. <br><br>
            
            
            Formula 1’s inaugural season featured seven rounds, spread out from May to September, predominantly staged in Europe – the exception being the Indianapolis 500 in the United States, which most F1 drivers sat out. <br><br>
            
            New European events arrived as F1 developed, with the following decades also bringing adventures to South America, North America, Africa, Asia, Australia and, most recently, the Middle East – well and truly putting the ‘world’ in world championship. <br><br></h3>
