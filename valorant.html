<h1><mark><u>What is Valorant?</u></mark></h1>
<h3> -VALORANT is a free-to-play first-person tactical shooter video game being developed and published by Riot Games. <br><br>

  It was announced on October 15, 2019 under the codename "Project A", until it was officially revealed as VALORANT on March 2, 2020. It was officially released on June 2nd, 2020 for PC. <br><br>
  
  By the time VALORANT reached its first anniversary, the game had 14 million active monthly players and Riot announced the game would soon be coming to mobile platforms, with console platforms also being explored but not as high a priority. Of the two platforms however, it was console that arrived first with a limited beta starting on June 14, 2024. <a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/VALORANT">Valorant Wiki</a> <br><br>

</h3>
<h3> - The game's primary objective is to engage in matches between two teams, each consisting of five players. A team wins the match after winning a combined total of at least 13 rounds as either the Attackers or Defenders. But if both Defenders and Attackers get up to the score 12-12,they would go to "Overtime" for Competitive or "Endgame" for Unrated.<br><br>

  The primary game mode involves the attackers trying to plant a device called the Spike at designated bomb sites, labeled A and B (some maps have an additional C site like Haven). In contrast, the defenders try to prevent the attackers from successfully planting the Spike or defuse it if it has been planted. <br><br>
  
  Attackers win by eliminating all defenders or successfully planting the spike and guarding it for 45 seconds. <br><br>
  
  Defenders win by eliminating all attackers or removing the spike after being planted. <br><br>
  
  Players can select from a pool of over 20 different agents. Agents can be unlocked through real money/currency or the in-game money which is called Kingdom Credits. It takes 8,000 Kingdom Credits to buy 1 Agent. <a href="https://help.playvs.com/en/articles/8659612-what-is-valorant" target="_blank">PlayVS</a> <br><br>

<h1>VALORANT ESPORTS</h1>
<h3>
- The very first competitive event launched by Riot Games was Ignition in 2020: a series of tournaments created in partnership with players, teams, content creators and tournament organisers from all over the world that focused on building the VALORANT competitive ecosystem. Prize pools for individual series finals ranged from a $5,000 to a whopping $50,000 prize pool. <br><br>
Riot Games announced the first VALORANT Champions Tour in November of the same year, dividing the tournament into a trilogy of tiers: Challengers, Masters and Champions. <br><br>
Challengers, the lowest tier, covered North America, Brazil, Latin America, EMEA, Southeast Asia, Korea and Japan. Beat Challengers and you'd move to Masters, with the top 16 teams advancing to Champions, the final tournament of VCT. <br><br>
Over 10,000 teams competed in the VCT in 2021, capturing its highest viewership at the Reykjavik Masters tournament in May with 1,085,850 people watching. <br><br>
VALORANT was well on its was to dominating the esports landscape, but there were still changes to come. <br><br>
2023 to the present saw a new format announced, with the season split into three international regions: Americas, EMEA and Pacific. Instead of Challengers, each would have an International League that could then qualify for Masters and Champions. Then, in 2024 a fourth regional league was launched in China and VALORANTs popularity continued to snowball. Currently, the event format sees 30 teams selected, with 10 teams per region. Non-partner teams can compete in Ascension events, with one winner per sub-region advancing to the respective International Leagues. <br><br><a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/history-of-valorant">RedBull</a><br><br>
